            <h2>1 Nephi 14:14</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints
                of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the
                face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.

            <h2>Mosiah 2:17</h2>
            <p>And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the
                great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work
                of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath
                made to his people who are of the house of Israel.</p>
