            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div id="profile">
                <div id="profile-text">
                    <p>I, Elaine, am both an Artist and a Scientist; which I think makes me quite interesting. I have a
                        First Class Degree in Ecology, completed in 2010, and I am now studying Software Development. I
                        hope to do a Masters after this, and perhaps one day a PhD?</p>
                    <p>I paint, draw and craft, but my main creative outlet is sewing. For my Business, I create machine
                        embroidery designs, and bag sewing patterns. I also sew clothes (currently creating a new
                        wardrobe for myself after weight loss), quilts, and anything else I can get under the needle. I
                        am also a "3D Printer" and have designed a couple of products.</p>
                    <p>About 18 months ago my husband was diagnosed with T2 Diabetes, so we decided to make some changes
                        to diet and exercise. I am now a Runner, running an average of 56 km/week for the last 6 months,
                        and have signed up to compete in my first full Marathon later this year. I'm very excited!</p>
                    <p>To complete the picture, I have been married for 28 years to the most wonderful man, and have
                        two adult children. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for
                        35 years. I love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and am so grateful to have the priveledge of
                        having a knowledge of the Gospel, and to have been sealed to my family for time and Eternity.

                    <h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>
                    <p>I have lived in Abu Dhabi for nearly 2 years now and absolutely love it here. Where I live I have
                        a view over Mangroves, and we are surrounded by gorgeous turquouse waters. Although we are in
                        the desert, the city is wonderfully green, with parks everywhere and flowers lining the streets.
                        There is also water everywhere! Abu Dhabi is split into a multitude of Islands, so you are never
                        far from the sea, and there are fountains and canals wherever you look. It takes about an hour
                        to get to actual sand dunes - and they are beautiful too. I am obsessed with the camles!</p>
